# House_3D_API

## Purpose and project objective 

- To model a house in 3D from lidar satellite images (geoTIFFs file) by only entering a home address
- Consolidate the knowledge in Python, specifically in : NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- To be able to search and implement new librairies
- To be able to read and use shapefiles
- To be able to read and use geoTIFFs
- To be able to render a 3D plot
- To be able to construct the project with object-oriented programming (OOP)
- To be able to implement the whole project - and make it functioning -  through an API
- To be able to present a final product

## Pitch of the project 

Put yourself in the shoes of a company, active in the Geospatial industy and whose purpose is to use lidar satellite image data to launch a new branch in the insurrance business. With this respect, the company needs you to build a solution with these data to model buildings in 3D with by only entering a home address.

What is LIDAR ? LIDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging and is a remote sensing method used to examine the surface of the Earth. LIDAR is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth. The device will illuminate a target with a laser light and a sensor will measure the reflection. Differences in wavelength and return times will be used to get 3D representations of an area.
